## Coding Rules

To keep the code base of commitlint neat and tidy the following rules apply to every change

- `prettier` is king
- `eslint` is awesome
- Favor micro library over swiss army knives (rimraf, ncp vs. fs-extra)
- Be awesome

> use commands `npm run eslint` and `npm run prettier:check` to be sure your code respect coding rules.

## Commit Rules

To help everyone with understanding the commit history of commitlint the following commit rules are enforced.

- [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.3/)
- husky commit message hook available
- present tense
- maximum of 100 characters
- for bugs, includes the github tag of the issue in the description.
- message format of `$type($scope): $message`

These are the authorized types:

- build
- ci
- chore
- docs
- feat
- fix
- perf
- refactor
- revert
- style
- test

## Versioning

`node-wifi` use [standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) to handle versioning
automatically. So you just need to follow commit rules and once the maintainer will want to  
release a version, he will use commands:

```bash
git pull origin master
npm run release
push --follow-tags origin master && npm publish
```

> Please do not use these commands if you don't have write capabilities on the repository. We want to
> have versions synchronized with npm so these commands should be executed in the same time.
